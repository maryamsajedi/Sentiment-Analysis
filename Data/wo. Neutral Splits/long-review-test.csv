good quality product its not the best tv entertainment unit in the market but its not the worse either particularly when its on sale and more so when your budget is tight pros decent wood color which gives a good look to your living room cons cheap wood size height is small 55inch tv fits well and not beyond no possibility of expansion they should have at least added wheels so that it will be easy to move around 95 kilograms of weight is quite heavy by any standards cheers,positive
nice it is not so strong do not move it after fixing material is light can with hold tv do not wipe with water cloth or any other liquid use only dry micro after cloth packaging is good they gave a strong base for putting tv on it so no problem seen as i put my 55 lg oled tv on it back of tv will have no cover good for heat to escape side and top structure cannot hold heavy material so go easy on them instead of getting shock from a carpenter to build this at high cost go for this and c,negative
strong but height is too short for tv base the build quality is strong enough but the biggest set back is the placement of tv it can easily fit 55 tv but the hight of the tv base is like only 15 feet from the ground which is sometimes very annoying if you stand you have to literally look at your knees to watch tv if you are good with that this is a definite recommendation,positive
worth the money item received quickly and installation arranged by flipkart next day ms jeeves installed the tv unit well and that too customers satisfaction their work was satisfactory i am giving 5 star for their work especially mr atul who was polite with customer and their satisfaction regarding wood looks good but the back cover is very thin to be improved also for me i am having 43 tv but tv area is moremy suggestion is we can improve more height on bottom tv area so that it average suits,positive

did not meet expectations first and foremost the quality is not good so if youre looking for something sturdy and for long term please look away secondly and more importantly the seller is the worst and so is the flipkart after sales team believe it or not i had to wait a staggering 2 months for this thing to get assembled and set up from the date of purchase first the delivery was delayed and so was the assembly then they found a part missing and hence the technician ordered for a replacement by this time 1 m,negative
not recommended at all | worst product cheap quality worst product i have ever purchased wood quality is just waste once installed at a place you can never think of moving it anywhere else this is the feedback from the technician who came to install this product you will always find some scratches here and there on this product and then when you request for return it is never gonna happen they are fooling me from last 3 weeks and no action has been taken yet there will be a technician visit who will never agree with your words and will,negative

unsatisfactory useless service provided by flipkart upon delivery of the product when their technician came for installation he told that it can not be installed as there were descrpency in the supplied product then i called flipkart to report this issue it was surprising that they dont have believe on their own technician so they send their inspector to check this after that their procedure for returning of product was started that was so irritating that every day i used to receive various msg abo,negative

worthless do not buy this product from flipkart at all as there will be a lot of difficulty in its installation after you buy it it will not be installed on time by the installation partner of flipkart if you call then all kinds of excuses will be made by them if you talk to the customer care of flipkart regarding the installation you will be reassured again and again but they will not take any kind of steps regarding the installationi am telling you all this because when i bought it after that,positive
very poor the images show a pretty decent product but that isnt the case at all i ordered it once and it has been a pretty bad experience due to the price the quality is very compromised the panels will start bending within 12days of installation the main issue however is the finishing you would find white scratches on every edge of this product and it makes the item look very bad like its some 45years old product my advice is to stay away from this product,negative

really nice have been using it for last few weeks and also took demo for basic functions it is good but dont consider curd making to be a good feature to make 500 gms curd one needs to mix 350 grams curd in milk and for 1 kg curd one needs to mix 750 grams curd so if one can buy 750 grams curd from market he can as well buy 1 kg i use it for reheating food purpose only,positive

great product very good product i am writing this review after using it for 3 years no complaints so far heats very well good quality only one suggestion if u just want to reheat ur food just buy a normal microwave oven which comes in very less price like rs 4000 or so this one is multi funtion like grilling reheating ets and costed me rs 8500 but since i purchased i m using it only for reheating and nothing else so think well before purchasing costly multifunction oven,positive

just wow! this is our 3rd microwave and so far i think this has been a great value for money buy thanks to big billion sale i bought for just 28k unlike our older godrej this reheats very fast 30 seconds for most liquids and a minute for rice our 15year old sharp microwave was equally good the mechanical control is one of the main reasons why i purchased this our godrejs pcb has been damaged twice i am hoping replacing the mechanical knobs would be cheaper the push button opening mechanism,positive

a third hand for my mom! i remember how fussed and busy my mother used to be in childhood baking this cooking that frying this sauting that well this microwave doesnt do all of that for sure but it has definitely taken care of a lot of things for our familys petpuja especially heating and boiling stuff are done in a jiffy no need to worry about foods losing taste without heat just take it out of the fridge and let the oven do its job for some seconds youll have the tasting buds dancing for moregen,positive
great microwave works as advertised as an engineer i love the simplicity of this no expensive and complicated touch panels that have the potential to go wrong it has a simple knob timer that uses a spring much like an egg timer or an old alarm clock that needs to be keyed so as long as the magnetron works this microwave will keep chugging along wonderfully i would rate this much higher than microwaves that are priced thrice as much as this for reliability design,positive
wonderful little microwave great build quality does what is supposed to for the price cant ask for more basic no frills oven highly recomended also yall bitching about demo driving lessons dont come with new car neither dressing lessons come with new clothings if you cant figure out how to use it then probably its not for you it doesnt deserve 1 or 2 stars for yall being so dumb,negative

brilliant those who have a nuclear family and are in search of a small but efficient microwave oven this is it doesnt take much space of your kitchen but this one from samsung delivers a fantastic service just one reminder you are buying the most basic micro oven expect that much service and you will get it if you talk about flipkart service its fantastic i got the product delivered in a nice manner by a gentleman at a very convenient time without any hassle so a big thumbs up for flipkart,positive
perfect solo m/w for solely reheating ive been using an lg convection 30l microwave for last 14 years but had hardly used anything more than reheating and once in a while defrosting so this time when the lg started showing signs of breaking down we decided we needed just a microwave for reheating purpose only sadly solo mw was just maximum of 20l ones and we wanted a bigger one we would have been happy if it were a 2530l but anyways this isnt bad either except that it is 15 lesser in height and width from the 30l,positive
super! i had been using a national now panasonic solo microwave since 1995 so you can imagine how tough it was to chose a replacement it was tough competition and samsung came out with flying colours it was the switches instead of touch and the ceremic coating which won the battle with other brands these were the two features because of which i didnt chose panasonic again the epoxy coating which other brands do is not tough enough panasonic still comes with rotary knobs in its solo option,negative

excellent solo microwave - perfect size - perfect price perfect microwave for the price perfect size neither small neither large in 23ltr category you will not find any solo microwave across any brand 99 cases we observed that we mostly use microwave for reheating rather cooking food the reason i decided to buy only solo moreover the buttons are tactile ones which tend to have much more longevity than the touch pad types for some unknown reason this particular model is not available at local dealers and electronic stores may be this mode,positive

really nice serves the purpose very well made of wroughtiron and plywood that may not be great for extreme weather condition as using it outdoors or in the rooftops but its great for indoors as computer table or study table the best part is that its huge and can hold up to a lot of things together just the down side is theres a little bit of hustle in the legroom if youre tall enough beyond 6ft otherwise its great and a must buy at this cheap price range,negative

good choice useful product for single adult use and even for kids for school from home in todays times manual is provided for assembling and all material available nothing missing but it was a difficult task required 1 person help while assembling the holes were not as deep as the length of screws need to carefully screw one end at the same time keep other end in alignment had to unscrew multiple times to align maybe by reading my review others can avoid same problem by keeping these points in mind,negative
wonderful the product is good for its price considering i got it around 28k but flipkart failed to provide an installation n we decided to do it on our own using the detailed manual provided two pieces one leg piece and table top piece were in fact drilled on the wrong side and hence the finished product couldnt be the perfect table this is the issue with installing it on our own we cant even return it but again for its price it is decent hence i gave 4 stars else it had to be 2 or 3,negative

good quality product the chair is a great overall product however as i am 6ft 1 the headrest is a bit too low although it can be adjusted the height adjustable is a bit awkward and the lumbar support is not too good might have to do a little diy modding to the back all in all the chair is great and the cellbell team has good customer support all the negatives i mentioned might be because of my height so if you are below 6ft the chair would be a good fit for you,positive
best in the market! the quality of product is really good easy to assemble length and height are perfect just the depth is little less otherwise a quality product the wood used is high density board and thus is very smooth and much stronger than particle boards a must buy product if depthwidth of the table is not a problem for you will suggest torche to build a bit more wide product probaby 55 cm depth will be a perfect size,positive
